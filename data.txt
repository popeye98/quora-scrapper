This is not an easy task.\n\nIf you want white collar office job, 9 to 5 computer work this organization is not for you.\n\nONGC may test your patience, strength, endurance, mental and muscle strength.\n\nIn ON OFF pattern your family life may get disturbed.\n\nOffshore, site duty, core field job are not meant for everyone.\n\nAs being a PSU you have time bound promotion. You can say its thankless job. No incentive for individual achievement beside appreciation email.\n\nNorth east posting at Assam and around is compulsory. Its not at all easy posting even though you are on ground."

And may complain about facilities at onshore fields."
